Chapter 7 - NiFi Development Environment Setup

I have to go thru this because my localhost is a Mac M1 - and Docker acts realy strange on it. 

If you are on Windows or Intel Mac you can setup Docker locally. 
This is going to be our target setup.

**How to build the Environment**

You must have an AWS account and AWs CLI installed and setup ([Follow link here to see how you do it](link to vid))

**Clone the repo onto your localhost and run:**
```
ApacheNifi/Chapter 7 - Setting Development Environment/scripts/Setup-EC2.sh
```

**Or you could run it step by step.**

You must complete Jenkins plugin installation in Web Browser.
